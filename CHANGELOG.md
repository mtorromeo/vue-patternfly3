## [0.2.0] - 2021-09-07
### Changed
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE**: Migrated the whole library to Vue 3. The project is now in **passive maintenance** mode. Only bug fixes will be applied to this library and development has moved to [vue-patternfly4](https://github.com/mtorromeo/vue-patternfly4).
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE**: The c3 library dependency and the chart components have been removed as part of the migration to Vue 3.
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE**: The `value` props of `pf-column-picker`, `pf-combobox`, `pf-dropdown`, `pf-option`, `pf-radio-button` and `pf-toggle` have been renamed to `model-value`. You can still bind with `v-model`.
